# Arduino 4-Finger Keyboard

This is the code for my Arduino implementation of a 4-finger keyboard based on the Kee4(tm) device (http://kee4.com).  It uses an Arduino Pro Micro to provide USB keyboard functionality.

For more details on my build, see http://projects.stuartm.me.uk/2019/01/06/4-finger-keyboard.html
